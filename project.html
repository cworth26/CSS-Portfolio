    <h1>Project 1 of Coding BootCamp üôåüèæ</h1>

    <p>For project 1, my group members and I thought it'd be really helpful for students to have a
        cool website that allowed them to look up daily definitions and have gifs (giphy images) pop
        up with the corresponding definition! Our user story stemmed from a school disctrict wanting a
        web application that allows you to search for words and have their definitions
        displayed with a fun and cool giphy image! For future improvement, we want to design the website
        to look like a motivational poster so that visually it's something that students will be interested in.
        We also would like to improve the enagement of the site it self and allow users to create login
        information, and give users the ability to comment on word and their definitions and to what their
        teacher and fellow classmates post.
        I invite you to check out the link the the project below.
